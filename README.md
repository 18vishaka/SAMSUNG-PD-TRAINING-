# Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators</summary>
	 
 **RTL**: In digital circuit design, it is a design abstraction which models the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. It is a critical step in the process of designing digital hardware. It bridges the gap between high-level functionality and the low-level gate-level implementation, allowing designers to express the desired behavior of a digital circuit in a human-readable and verifiable form.


Here is an example considering a 1 bit adder with carry:
(RTL code snippet and Gate level code snippet respectively)
<img width="1085" alt="Snippets" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/Snippets.png"><br><br>


 **Design** :  A design in Verilog is a digital circuit description that defines how various digital components are connected to achieve a specific functionality. It serves as a blueprint for creating digital systems, which can be tested and synthesized for hardware implementation.
<img width="1085" alt="design_concept" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/design_concept.png"><br><br>


**Testbench**: A setup to apply stimulus (test_vector) to the design to check its functionality. It is a separate piece of code written to simulate the behavior of the digital circuit or component you are designing or testing. It provides the necessary inputs and monitors the outputs of the design under test.
<img width="1085" alt="Testbench_1" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/Testbench_1.jpeg"><br><br>

**Simulator**: RTL design is checked for adherence to its design specification using simulation by giving simple inputs. The tool used for this purpose is called Simulator. The simulator looks at the input changes and then evaluates the output. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.  


NOTE:
<ul>
	<li>Design may have one or more primary inputs, one or more primary outputs.</li>
	<li>Testbench does'nt have primary inputs nor primary outputs.</li>
</ul>

<summary>Lab-1: Introduction to using iverilog and gtkwave (Part-1)</summary>
(All the lab examples will be performed on the Linux operating system.)<br><br>

 **Iverilog**: Icarus Verilog (Iverilog) is a versatile tool for digital design engineers, enabling them to both simulate and, to some extent, synthesize digital circuits described in Verilog. It aids in the development and testing of digital hardware designs, ensuring their correctness and functionality before they are physically implemented.

 **Gtkwave**: GTKWave is a versatile waveform viewer used in digital design and simulation for visualizing and analyzing simulation results. It plays a crucial role in the debugging and verification of digital hardware designs by providing an intuitive and interactive representation of the signals' behavior over time.

**iverilog based simulation flow** :
<img width="1085" alt="iverilog_sim_flow" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/iverilog_sim_flow.png"><br><br>


**Steps involved**:

Step-1: Initially a directory named VLSI is created, inside this directory we cloned sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop repository; this repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes for practice.<br><br>
<img width="1085" alt="Intro_iverilog_gtk" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/Intro_iverilog_gtk.png"><br>
Here "my_lib" contains all the library files needed and it contains a folder "verilog_model" that contains all the standard cell verilog model which are present in the .lib. "verilog_files" is the folder which contains all the lab experiments, and also all verilog source files and testbench files are present here.


Step-2: Loading the design in iverilog (loading multiplexer into the simulator), we see that 'a.out' gets created. Then execute 'a.out', on execution it's going to dump a vcd file.<br><br>
<img width="1085" alt="iverilog_lab" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/iverilog_lab.png"><br>


Step-3: Loading this VCD file into gtkwave simulator.<br><br>
<img width="1085" alt="gtkwave_lab" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/gtkwave_lab.png"><br><br>
<img width="1085" alt="gtkwave_lab_1" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/gtkwave_lab_1.png"><br><br>

From the above waveforms it is clear that when the select line is 0 (sel=0) the output "y" follows input "i0" and when the select line is 1 (sel=1) the output "y" follows input "i1" which is the functionality of a mux.


This is how we load the design and check for its functionality.

<summary>Introduction to Yosys</summary>

 **Synthesis**: Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. It is a process of converting a RTL code into a gate level netlist. The tool used for this purpose is called synthesizer.
<img width="1085" alt="Synthesizer_1" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/Synthesizer_1.png">
<img width="1085" alt="Synthesizer" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/Synthesizer.png"><br><br>
 

 **Yosys** : Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and verification flows.

 Here is the yosys setup:
 <img width="1085" alt="yosys_setup" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/yosys_setup.png"><br><br>
 

**Verification of synthesized design** : In order to make sure that there are no errors in netlist we need to verify the netlist generated by synthesizer. This can be done by giving netlist and testbench to a simulator which in turn produces a .vcd file , then verifying the vcd file gtkwave. The output produced by this vcd file should be same as the one generated by the RTL design code.
<img width="1085" alt="synth_verification" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/synth_verification.png"><br><br>

**.lib** : It is a collection of logical modules, includes basic logic gates like and, or, not, etc.... and also includes different flavors of same gate.

**Faster Cells Vs Slower Cells** :
<ul>
	<li>Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence.</li>
	<li>Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the celll delay. However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need WIDE TRANSISTORS.</li>
	<li>Wider transistors have lesser delay but consume more area and power. Narrow transistors are other way around. Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.</li>
</ul>

**Selection of the Cells** : We'll need to guide the Synthesizer to choose the flavour of cells that is optimum for implementation of logic circuit. Keeping in view of previous observations of faster vs slower cells,to avoid hold time violations, larger circuits, sluggish circuits, we offer guidance to synthesizer in the form of Constraints.

(An overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX were explained.)<br><br>
 
 **Procedure** : 
 First we need to read the liberty file using the code

## Day-2-Timing libs, Hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles

	
<details>
<summary>Introduction to timing .libs </summary><br>
 A look at how exactly a .lib file looks like and what it consists of:
 <img width="1085" alt="lib_intro" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/lib_intro.png">


 library ("sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80") gives the name of the liberty file being used. "sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80" is a  130nm technology library file where 'tt' stands for typical library; '025C' is the temperature value and '1v80' is the voltage value  of this libarary file.
<ul>		
	<li>Typically a library file consists of cell timing information, library variations, operating conditions, timing models, constraints and timing arcs.</li>
	<li>These liberty files are crucial in the design flow to ensure that the designed integrated circuits meet their timing requirements and can operate reliably under various conditions.</li>
	
</ul>

**Operating Conditions:**
.lib files often include data for different operating conditions, such as variations in voltage and temperature (PVT corners). This data helps designers assess how the library cells will perform under different conditions, considering the Process Voltage Temperature (PVT) variations 


**Proccess Voltage Temperature (PVT):**
<ul>
	<li>Process Variation: This aspect of PVT deals with the inherent variability that exists in the manufacturing process of semiconductor devices. In semiconductor fabrication, tiny variations can occur in things like the thickness of oxide layers, the doping levels of transistors, and other factors. These variations can lead to differences in the electrical characteristics of individual transistors and other components on a chip. Process variations can result in some transistors being faster or slower than others, consuming more or less power, and so on.</li>
	<li>Voltage Variation: Voltage variation refers to changes in the supply voltage that powers the IC. Variations in supply voltage can occur due to factors like power supply noise, voltage droops, or fluctuations. These voltage variations can impact the performance and power consumption of the IC. Chips are typically designed to operate within a specified voltage range, and deviations from this range can lead to functional errors or reduced performance.</li>
	<li>Temperature Variation: Temperature variation refers to changes in the operating temperature of the IC. Integrated circuits are sensitive to temperature, and their performance can vary with temperature changes. Higher temperatures can lead to increased leakage current and power consumption. Additionally, the speed of transistors can be affected by temperature; they may operate faster at lower temperatures and slower at higher temperatures.</li>
	<li>In summary, Process Voltage Temperature (PVT) variations are an essential aspect of VLSI design and manufacturing, encompassing the inherent variability in the manufacturing process, voltage supply fluctuations, and temperature changes that can affect the performance and reliability of integrated circuits.</li>
</ul>

**Know .lib well:**
<ul>
	<li>The technology("cmos") line is typically a command or directive that specifies the technology or process to be used for characterizing the library cells. 
	<img width="1085" alt="intro_lib_1" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/into_lib_1.png"></li><br><br>
 	<li>Specifying units of time and other physical parameters is crucial for accurately characterizing and describing the behavior of library cells. These units help ensure consistency and compatibility when designing integrated circuits.
	<img width="1085" alt="intro_lib_2" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/intro_lib_2.png"></li><br><br>
 	<li>There are going to be many cells in the library file, "cell" is the keyword that marks the beginning of cell definition, they contain different features of the particular cell; the cells that are described and characterized represent the fundamental building blocks used in designing digital integrated circuits. These cells serve various logical and sequential functions and are essential for constructing complex digital circuits.</li>
  	<li>let us consider a AND gate with two inputs:
	<img width="1085" alt="intro_lib_3" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/intro_lib_3.png"><br><br>
		For each gate cell based on the number of inputs(N), there will be 2^N combinations, and for each combination leakage power, area, delay, and all related parameters will be mentioned. For example, here the above AND gate is having two inputs, each of these two inputs potentially can take low or high any of the two values; that is 2 to the power 2 which is 4 possible input combinations that exists. For each of these 4 possible input combinations we need to know what is the delay, power and other related parameters; all of those information are present in each cell definitions.</li>
  	<li>The "area" parameter in a .lib file specifies the physical size or footprint of a library cell on the silicon wafer. It plays a crucial role in various stages of VLSI chip design. Accurate and well-characterized area values are essential for designing efficient and cost-effective integrated circuits.</li>


   Understanding many different variations of the same gate cells:
   <img width="1085" alt="lib_area" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/lib_area.png"><br>
   <ul>
	<li>"and2_0", "and2_2", "and2_4" are different flavors of the same AND cell.</li>
	<li>As we go from cell "and2_0" to "and2_4" the area increases from 6.256 to 8.7584, what we infer from this is that "and2_4" is larger cell than "and2_2" and from "and2_0". Larger cell meaning it is employing wider transistor.</li>
 	<li>Wider cells will be faster, area is more therefore power is more.</li>
  	<li>Smaller cells delay will be more, area is less hence the power.</li>
   	<li>Intermediate cells which are not wider nor small have intermediate characteristic.</li>
   </ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hierarchical vs flat synthesis</summary>

	
 **Hierarchical Synthesis:**
Hierarchical synthesis in Verilog is a design practice that involves breaking down complex digital designs into modular blocks or modules and organizing them in a hierarchical structure. This approach offers advantages such as modularity, reusability, easier debugging, parallel development, and efficient synthesis. It is a common and recommended practice for designing large and complex digital systems.

**Flat Synthesis:**
Flat synthesis in Verilog involves describing an entire digital design within a single module, without any hierarchical organization or modular separation. While it may be suitable for simple designs, it is not recommended for complex projects, as it can lead to challenges in readability, reusability, and efficient resource utilization. Hierarchical synthesis is the more common and recommended approach for managing complex digital designs.

Consider a 1 bit full adder it can either be described using gates or by considering a half adder as a module too.
<img width="1085" alt="hier_vs_flat" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/hier_vs_flat.jpeg"><br><br>
<img width="1085" alt="hier_vs_flat_1" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/hier_vs_flat_1.jpeg"><br><br>


Consider a multimodule combinational circuit which consists of two sub_modules one that of a AND gate and other of a OR gate:
<img width="1085" alt="mul_module" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/mul_module.png"><br><br>

After performing synthesis using yosys it generates the following schematic:
<img width="1085" alt="mul_module_1" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/mul_module_1.png"><br><br>

The netlist code for hierarchical implementation of the multiple_modules

```ruby
module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
  input a;
  input b;
  input c;
  wire net1;
  output y;
  sub_module1 u1 (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .y(net1)
  );
  sub_module2 u2 (
    .a(net1),
    .b(c), 
    .y(y)
  );
endmodule

module sub_module1(a, b, y);
  wire _0_;
  wire _1_;
  wire _2_;
  input a;
  input b;
  output y;
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _3_ (
    .A(_1_),
    .B(_0_),
    .X(_2_)
  );
  assign _1_ = b;
  assign _0_ = a;
  assign y = _2_;
endmodule

module sub_module2(a, b, y);
  wire _0_;
  wire _1_;
  wire _2_;
  input a;
  input b;
  output y;
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__or2_0 _3_ (
    .A(_1_),
    .B(_0_),
    .X(_2_)
  );
  assign _1_ = b;
  assign _0_ = a;
  assign y = _2_;
endmodule
```
In the netlist we can observe that separate modules namely sub_module1 sub_module2 are getting instanstiated not the gate cells.

**Flat synthesis** : In Flat synthesis the hierarchies the flattened  out and there is a single module in the netlist i.e the gates are instantiated directly instead of submodules. We apply flat synthesis on the same  design mentioned above. The command used to perform Flat synthesis from yosys are as follows

**read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 **synth -top <instance_name>**

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
 **flatten**

**write_verilog -noattr <File_name>**

The synthesized circuit for a flattened netlist: (submodules u1 and u2 are flattened)
<img  width="1085" alt="flat" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/flat.png">

The netlist code of the flattened synthesis is as follows
```ruby
module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
  wire _0_;
  wire _1_;
  wire _2_;
  wire _3_;
  wire _4_;
  wire _5_;
  input a;
  input b;
  input c;
  wire net1;
  wire \u1.a ;
  wire \u1.b ;
  wire \u1.y ;
  wire \u2.a ;
  wire \u2.b ;
  wire \u2.y ;
  output y;
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _6_ (
    .A(_1_),
    .B(_0_),
    .X(_2_)
  );
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__or2_0 _7_ (
    .A(_4_),
    .B(_3_),
    .X(_5_)
  );
  assign _4_ = \u2.b ;
  assign _3_ = \u2.a ;
  assign \u2.y  = _5_;
  assign \u2.a  = net1;
  assign \u2.b  = c;
  assign y = \u2.y ;
  assign _1_ = \u1.b ;
  assign _0_ = \u1.a ;
  assign \u1.y  = _2_;
  assign \u1.a  = a;
  assign \u1.b  = b;
  assign net1 = \u1.y ;
endmodule
```
There is only a single module seen which consist of the gate level instantion of the two submodules .


Performing synthesis at the sub-module level is considered a best practice, especially for large and complex designs, as it simplifies the debugging process and enhances efficiency. This approach becomes particularly beneficial when dealing with multiple instances of the same module. Instead of synthesizing each instance separately, we can synthesize one and replicate it for others, effectively stitching them together. 


The synthesized circuit and netlist image of sub_module1 as an example of this approach:

	<summary>Flop coding styles</summary>
(Will be looking into how to code a flop, what are the different types of flops available, how to use them and what are the different coding styles possible.)<br><br>
	
 **Flip Flop:**
 A flip-flop is a fundamental building block in digital circuits and is used to store a single binary digit (either a 0 or a 1) of data. Flip-flops are used extensively in sequential logic circuits and play a critical role in the storage and transfer of data within a digital system.

 **D Flip Flop:**
A D flip-flop, also known as a Data or Delay flip-flop, is a fundamental building block in digital electronics and sequential logic circuits. It's a type of flip-flop that has a single data input (D), a clock input (CLK), and two outputs: Q and Q-bar (the complement of Q). The primary function of a D flip-flop is to store the value of its data input (D) and then transfer that stored value to its Q output on the rising or falling edge of the clock signal, depending on the specific type of D flip-flop used.

**Setup and Hold time:**
<ul>
	<li>Setup time: refers to the minimum amount of time that the data input (D) must be stable and valid before the active edge of the clock signal (usually the rising edge or falling edge) arrives for the flip-flop to reliably capture and store the data.
	<img  width="1085" alt="setup" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/setup.jpeg"></li>
	<li>Hold time: refers to the minimum amount of time that the data input (D) must be held stable and unchanged after the active edge of the clock signal (usually the rising edge or falling edge) has occurred for the flip-flop to reliably capture and store the data.
	<img  width="1085" alt="hold" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/hold.jpeg"></li>
</ul>

**What is an efficient coding style?**
Considering a scenario say, efficient coding style between using two adders and a 2:1 multiplexer (mux) or two 2:1 muxes and an adder depends on your specific requirements of th design, the target hardware platform, and optimization goals such as area, speed, or power consumption.
<img  width="1085" alt="eff_coding" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/eff_coding.jpeg">

It is wise to choose the circuit with two 2:1 mux and an adder as adde consumes more area. This provides us a basic insight towards efficient coding style.

**Why flip flops?**
<ul>
	<li>Flip-flops are fundamental components in digital circuit design because they enable the storage of information, sequential operation, synchronization, and control necessary for a wide range of digital applications. They are building blocks that form the basis of complex digital systems, from simple registers to advanced microprocessors.</li>
	<li>In the realm of combinational circuits, outputs respond to input changes with a delay known as propagation delay. When data propagates through various paths within a circuit, each characterized by distinct propagation delays, the possibility of generating undesirable signal anomalies known as "glitches", becomes a concern. A glitch is an abrupt, short-lived alteration in a signal's value, typically occurring when a logic level experiences multiple transitions in a brief timeframe. In scenarios involving multiple combinational circuits within a design, the likelihood of glitches occurring multiplies, jeopardizing the overall stability of the circuit's output. To address this challenge, flip-flops are introduced.</li>
</ul>

 **Asynchronous Reset D Flip Flop:**
Input is affected by an immediate reset signal, without waiting for the clock edge. When the asynchronous reset is active (usually low), the flip-flop's output is forced to a predefined state, often logic low, regardless of the clock signal. 

RTL Design code of positive edge trigerred asynchronous reset D Flop:
```ruby
 module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
	always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
	begin
		if(async_reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else	
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule
```

**Asynchronous Set D Flip Flop**

The D (data) input is affected by an immediate set signal, without waiting for the clock edge. When the asynchronous set is active (usually low), the flip-flop's output is forced to a predefined state, often logic high, regardless of the clock signal. 

RTL Design code of positive edge trigerred asynchronous set D Flop:
```ruby
module dff_async_set ( input clk ,  input async_set , input d , output reg q );
	always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_set)
	begin
		if(async_set)
			q <= 1'b1;
		else
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule
```

**Synchronous Reset D Flip Flop**

The D (data) input is affected by the reset signal, but the reset action only occurs at the clock edge (either rising or falling edge), ensuring synchronized and predictable behavior.

RTL Design code of positive edge trigerred synchronous reset D Flop:
```ruby
module dff_syncres ( input clk , input async_reset , input sync_reset , input d , output reg q );
	always @ (posedge clk )
	begin
		if (sync_reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else	
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule

	<summary>Interesting optimisations</summary>
	In various scenarios, additional hardware components are unnecessary for circuit implementation. For instance, when multiplying a 3-bit number by 2, there's no need for extra hardware; we can achieve this simply by connecting certain bits to the output and grounding the least significant bit (LSB). This practical approach has been successfully implemented using tools like Yosys:

```ruby
module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2;
endmodule
```
When dealing with multiplication by powers of 2, the operation essentially involves shifting, as illustrated in the image below:
<img  width="1085" alt="mul_2" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day2/mul_2.jpeg">

The next special case involves multiplying a 3-bit number by 9, resulting in the pattern shown in the image below:

```ruby
module mul8 (input [2:0] a, output [5:0] y);
	assign y = a * 9;
endmodule
```

 **Optimisation Methodology:**
 <ul>
	<li>The synthesis tool performs optimisation by minimizing cost functions- one for design rule costs and the other for optimisation costs.</li> 
	 <li>The cost functions come in various flavors depending on the EDA tool vendor.</li>
  	<li>Since synthesis results are dependent to a large extent on several factors such as constraints, libraries and coding styles, optimisation of a design is an iterative process.</li>
   <li>The optimisation cost function consists of your parts in the following order of importance:
   <ul><li>Max delay cost</li>
 <li>Min delay cost</li>
 <li>Max power cost</li>
 <li>max area cost</li></ul></li>

**Basic Identities of boolean algebra:**<br>
Here's a table of basic identities of Boolean algebra-

| Identity Name              | AND Form                 | OR Form                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Identity Law            | A · 1 = A                | A + 0 = A               |
| Domination Law          | A · 1 = A                | A + 1 = 1               |
| Idempotent Law          | A · A = A                | A + A = A               |
| Complement Law          | A + A' = 1               | A · A' = 0              |
| Double Negation Law     | A = A''                  | A = A''                 |
| Commutative Law         | A · B = B · A            | A + B = B + A           |
| Associative Law         | (A · B) · C = A · (B · C) | (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)|
| Distributive Law        | A + (B · C) = (A + B) · (A + C) | A · (B + C) = (A · B) + (A · C) |
| Absorption Law          | A . (A + B) = A          | A + (A . B) = A         |
| De Morgan's Law         | (A . B)' = A' + B'       | (A + B)' = A' . B'      |
| Consensus Theorem       | (A + B) · (A' + C) · (B + C) = (A + B) · (A' + C) | (A · B) + (A' · C) + (B · C) = (A · B) + (A' · C) |

These identities are fundamental in Boolean algebra and are used for simplifying and manipulating logical expressions. The "AND Form" represents how the identity looks in terms of multiplication (logical AND), and the "OR Form" represents how it looks in terms of addition (logical OR).


**Combinational Optimisation:**
Combinational optimization deals with optimizing the combinational logic portion of a digital circuit. Combinational logic is a type of logic where the output depends only on the current input values, without any consideration for past input values or internal state.

Techniques used for combinational logic optimisation:<ul>
	<li>Constant Propagation
	<ul>
		<li>Direct optimisation</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Boolean Logic Optimisation
	<ul>
		<li>K-map</li>
		<li>Quine Mckluskey</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

**Sequential Optimization:**
Sequential optimization focuses on optimizing the sequential logic portion of a digital circuit. Sequential logic includes elements like flip-flops, registers, and state machines, where the output depends not only on the current inputs but also on the previous state of the circuit.

Techniques used for sequential logic optimisation:<ul>
	<li>Sequential constant propagation</li>
	<li>State optimisation</li>
	<li>Retiming</li>
	<li>Sequential Logic Cloning (Floor Plan aware synthesis)</li>
</ul>
