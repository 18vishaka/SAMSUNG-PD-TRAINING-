# Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators</summary>
	 
 **RTL**: In digital circuit design, it is a design abstraction which models the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. It is a critical step in the process of designing digital hardware. It bridges the gap between high-level functionality and the low-level gate-level implementation, allowing designers to express the desired behavior of a digital circuit in a human-readable and verifiable form.

 
**Testbench**: A setup to apply stimulus (test_vector) to the design to check its functionality. It is a separate piece of code written to simulate the behavior of the digital circuit or component you are designing or testing. It provides the necessary inputs and monitors the outputs of the design under test.

**Simulator**: RTL design is checked for adherence to its design specification using simulation by giving simple inputs. The tool used for this purpose is called Simulator. The simulator looks at the input changes and then evaluates the output. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.  

NOTE:
<ul>
	<li>Design may have one or more primary inputs, one or more primary outputs.</li>
	<li>Testbench does'nt have primary inputs nor primary outputs.</li>
</ul>

<summary>Lab-1: Introduction to using iverilog and gtkwave</summary>
(All the lab examples will be performed on the Linux operating system.)<br><br>

 **Iverilog**: Icarus Verilog (Iverilog) is a versatile tool for digital design engineers, enabling them to both simulate and, to some extent, synthesize digital circuits described in Verilog. It aids in the development and testing of digital hardware designs, ensuring their correctness and functionality before they are physically implemented.

 **Gtkwave**: GTKWave is a versatile waveform viewer used in digital design and simulation for visualizing and analyzing simulation results. It plays a crucial role in the debugging and verification of digital hardware designs by providing an intuitive and interactive representation of the signals' behavior over time.

**Steps involved**:

Step-1: Initially a directory named VLSI is created, inside this directory we cloned sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop repository; this repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes for practice.<br><br>
<img width="1085" alt="Intro_iverilog_gtk" src="https://github.com/18vishaka/SAMSUNG-PD-TRAINING-/blob/master/practice_1%23day0/Intro_iverilog_gtk.png"><br>
Here "my_lib" contains all the library files needed and it contains a folder "verilog_model" that contains all the standard cell verilog model which are present in the .lib. "verilog_files" is the folder which contains all the lab experiments, and also all verilog source files and testbench files are present here.


Step-2: Loading the design in iverilog (loading multiplexer into the simulator), we see that 'a.out' gets created. Then execute 'a.out', on execution it's going to dump a vcd file.<br><br>

 <summary>Introduction to Yosys</summary>

 **Synthesis**: Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. It is a process of converting a RTL code into a gate level netlist. The tool used for this purpose is called synthesizer.

 **Yosys** : Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and verification flows.

**Verification of synthesized design** : In order to make sure that there are no errors in netlist we need to verify the netlist generated by synthesizer. This can be done by giving netlist and testbench to a simulator which in turn produces a .vcd file , then verifying the vcd file gtkwave. The output produced by this vcd file should be same as the one generated by the RTL design code.

**Faster Cells Vs Slower Cells** :Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence. Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the celll delay. However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need WIDE TRANSISTORS.

Wider transistors have lesser delay but consume more area and power. Narrow transistors are other way around. Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.

Selection of the Cells: We'll need to guide the Synthesizer to choose the flavour of cells that is optimum for implementation of logic circuit. Keeping in view of previous observations of faster vs slower cells,to avoid hold time violations, larger circuits, sluggish circuits, we offer guidance to synthesizer in the form of Constraints.

<summary>Labs on Yosys </summary>
 We were given the overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX. 
 
 **Procedure** : First we need to read the liberty file using the code
 
 **read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 Then we need read the RTL Design code

 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 After this we need to perform synthesis 

 **synth -top <instance_name>**
 
 generating netlist

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
This Netlist can be viewed in the synthesized circuit form using the **show** command
